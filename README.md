## 🌟 Project Overview

This is a front-end replica of Netflix's homepage built using **HTML5** and **CSS3** only — no frameworks, no JavaScript.  
The goal was to understand how large-scale media platforms manage clean UI structure, dark themes, and interactive sections.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I chose to replicate Netflix because of its modern layout, strong typography, and smooth user flow.  
Creating a dark-theme UI from scratch helped me improve my CSS structuring and visual balance skills.

## 🎨 Design Focus

This project focused on replicating:
- A modern, dark-theme layout with high contrast
- Bold, clean typography and centered messaging
- Structured sections with spacing and alignment
- Form design with visual hierarchy

## 🔍 Key Features

- Full-screen background hero section with text, form, and overlay
- Netflix-style header with logo and sign-in button
- Centered content with responsive typography and layout
- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section styled cleanly
- Basic email input field with call-to-action button
- Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Clean footer with grouped links

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Working with background overlays and full-screen layout
- Using `flexbox` and `positioning` for header and content
- Handling responsive text and form layouts
- Creating clean, readable HTML and CSS without frameworks
- Mimicking real-world UI design in a self-contained project

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Add interactivity using JavaScript (FAQ dropdown, form validation)
- Include animation on scroll for better UX
- Add actual login and registration form structure
- Connect email form with a real back-end (Firebase or PHP)
- Create light/dark toggle using CSS variables

## 🧪 Tested On

- Google Chrome (Desktop)
- Microsoft Edge (Desktop)
